# Advisor — Hardware Team Contributions (TUM, 2025)

PCB design and circuit planning for the Advisor project at TUM in 2025.

## The Project

The Advisor project aimed to design and build a robot capable of competing in three of five possible disciplines: golf, soccer, sprint, slalom, and basketball.

During the first half of the project, students were divided into teams and attended weekly workshops focused on soft skills and teamwork. In the second half, each team developed their own robot. The project concluded with a public presentation and a competition between teams.

Our team’s robot was designed for the golf, soccer, and slalom disciplines.

## Purpose

This repository contains the **hardware contributions** I made to the group "Team JJ" during the Advisor project as part of the hardware team.  
The goal was to design the **PCB board** and **circuit plan** to support the project’s electronic requirements.

## My Contribution

- Designed the **PCB layout** including component placement and routing.  
- Created the **circuit schematic** to define system connections and component specifications.  
- Generated **Gerber files** and **3D visualizations** of the PCB.  
- Documented all hardware deliverables for integration with the software team.
